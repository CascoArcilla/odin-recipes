<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Traditional dish of Italian cuisine that is prepared with overlapping sheets of pasta, filled with a sauce that
  usually contains meat and cheese.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>3 1/2 pounds ground beef</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder Garlic powder</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of MAGGI® Beef Broth</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1/3 cup finely chopped onion</li>
  <li>3 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup finely chopped celery</li>
  <li>1 sachet of MAGGI® Bolognese Tomato Sauce</li>
  <li>3/4 cup of water</li>
  <li>4 bay leaves</li>
  <li>3/4 pound cooked lasagna pasta Pre-cooked lasagna pasta</li>
  <li>2 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  <li>1 cup parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
  <li>In a bowl, place the meat, garlic powder, MAGGI® 2 Beef Broth, and ground pepper and marinate for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>In a large saucepan, place the oil, onion, garlic, and celery and sauté for 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the meat and cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
  <li>When the meat acquires a light gray hue, add the MAGGI® Bolognese Style Tomato Sauce, water, bay leaves, salt and
    pepper and cook over medium heat for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li>Assembling the lasagna: When assembling the lasagna, grease a refractory container or the tray you use with a
    little oil. Place a small amount of sauce, cover the bottom of the tray with pre-cooked pasta slices, pour a small
    amount of meat, add the mozzarella cheese and a minimal part of Parmesan cheese.</li>
  <li>Repeat this procedure until the container is filled. Finally, place a layer of pre-cooked pasta, the remaining
    sauce and cover with the cheeses. The lasagna has to have a good amount of liquid for the pasta to cook. If it is
    very dry, you can add chicken broth.</li>
  <li>Cover it with aluminum foil and place in the oven at 150°C for 40 minutes.</li>
  <li>Additional step: You can add black olives and basil leaves to this recipe when cooking the meat.</li>
