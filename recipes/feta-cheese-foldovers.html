    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped green onions</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk, beaten with 1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>
  
  
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, blend feta cheese, green onions, and egg. Cut pastry into 12 (3 inch) squares. Place a mounded
        tablespoon of feta mixture in the center of each square. Moisten edges with water, and fold pastry over filling to
        form a triangle. Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal. Lightly brush pastries with the egg yolk mixture.

      <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
